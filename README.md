A copy of Shubham Saboo repository modified to compare scripts. 
An AI Powered Streamlit application that serves as your personal coding assistant, powered by multiple Agents built on the new o3-mini model. You can also upload an image of a coding problem or describe it in text, and the AI agent will analyze, generate an optimal solution, and execute it in a sandbox environment.(Sandbox Disable)

## Features
#### Multi-Modal Problem Input
- Upload images of coding problems (supports PNG, JPG, JPEG)
- Type problems in natural language
- Automatic problem extraction from images
- Interactive problem processing

#### Intelligent Code Generation
- Optimal solution generation with best time/space complexity
- Clean, documented Python code output
- Type hints and proper documentation
- Edge case handling

#### Secure Code Execution
- Sandboxed code execution environment
- Real-time execution results
- Error handling and explanations
- 30-second execution timeout protection

#### Multi-Agent Architecture
- Vision Agent (Gemini-2.0-flash) for image processing
- Coding Agent (OpenAI- o3-mini) for solution generation
- Execution Agent (OpenAI) for code running and result analysis
- E2B Sandbox for secure code execution

## How to Run

Follow the steps below to set up and run the application:
- Get an OpenAI API key from: https://platform.openai.com/
- Get a Google (Gemini) API key from: https://makersuite.google.com/app/apikey
- Get an E2B API key from: https://e2b.dev/docs/getting-started/api-key

1. **Clone the Repository**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Shubhamsaboo/awesome-llm-apps.git
   cd ai_agent_tutorials/ai_coding_agent_o3-mini
   ```

2. **Install the dependencies**
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

3. **Run the Streamlit app**
    ```bash
    streamlit run ai_coding_agent_o3.py
    ```

4. **Configure API Keys**
   - Enter your API keys in the sidebar
   - All three keys (OpenAI, Gemini, E2B) are required for full functionality

## Usage
1. Upload an image of a coding problem OR type your problem description
2. Click "Generate & Execute Solution"
3. View the generated solution with full documentation
4. See execution results and any generated files
5. Review any error messages or execution timeouts


Environment Configuration Files
We will use two main files:

requirements.txt: Lists all Python dependencies specific to the project
environment.yml: Configures the conda environment and uses requirements.txt

Setup with conda (Recommended)
# Clone the repository
git clone [repository-URL]
cd [repository-name]

# Create the environment using the environment.yml file
conda env create -f environment.yml

# Activate the environment
conda activate ai_coding_agent_o3-mini

# Run the application
streamlit run ai_coding_agent_o3.py

Alternative setup with pip and venv
# Clone the repository
git clone [repository-URL]
cd [repository-name]

# Create virtual environment
python -m venv ai_coding_agent_o3-mini

# Activate the environment (Windows)
ai_coding_agent_o3-mini\Scripts\activate.bat

# Install dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt

# Run the application
streamlit run ai_coding_agent_o3.py
